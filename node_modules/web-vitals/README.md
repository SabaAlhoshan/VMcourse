## Overview

The `web-vitals` library is a tiny (~1K), modular library for measuring all the [Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/) metrics on real users, in a way that accurately matches how they're measured by Chrome and reported to other Google tools (e.g. [Chrome User Experience Report](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-user-experience-report), [Page Speed Insights](https://developers.google.com/speed/pagespeed/insights/), [Search Console's Speed Report](https://webmasters.googleblog.com/2019/11/search-console-speed-report.html)).

The library supports all of the [Core Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/#core-web-vitals) as well as all of the [other Web Vitals](https://web.dev/vitals/#other-web-vitals) that can be measured [in the field](https://web.dev/user-centric-performance-metrics/#how-metrics-are-measured):

### Core Web Vitals

- [Cumulative Layout Shift (CLS)](https://web.dev/cls/)
- [First Input Delay (FID)](https://web.dev/fid/)
- [Largest Contentful Paint (LCP)](https://web.dev/lcp/)

### Other Web Vitals

- [First Contentful Paint (FCP)](https://web.dev/fcp/)
- [Time to First Byte (TTFB)](https://web.dev/time-to-first-byte/)

## Install and load the library

<a name="import-web-vitals-from-npm"><a>

### From npm

You can install this library from npm by running:

```sh
npm install web-vitals
```

_**Note:** If you're not using npm, you can still load `web-vitals` via `<script>` tags from a CDN like [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com). See the [load `web-vitals` from a CDN](#load-web-vitals-from-a-cdn) usage example below for details._

There are two different versions of the `web-vitals` library (the "standard" version and the "base+polyfill" version), and how you load the library depends on which version you want to use.

For details on the difference between the two versions, see <a href="#which-bundle-is-right-for-you">which bundle is right for you</a>.

**1. The "standard" version**

To load the "standard" version, import modules from the `web-vitals` package in your application code (as you would with any npm package and node-based build tool):

```js
import {getLCP, getFID, getCLS} from 'web-vitals';

getCLS(console.log);
getFID(console.log);
getLCP(console.log);
```

<a name="how-to-use-the-polyfill"><a>

**2. The "base+polyfill" version**

Loading the "base+polyfill" version is a two-step process:

First, in your application code, import the "base" build rather than the "standard" build. To do this, change any `import` statements that reference `web-vitals` to `web-vitals/base`:

```diff
- import {getLCP, getFID, getCLS} from 'web-vitals';
+ import {getLCP, getFID, getCLS} from 'web-vitals/base';
```

Then, inline the code from `dist/polyfill.js` into the `<head>` of your pages. This step is important since the "base" build will error if the polyfill code has not been added.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script>
      // Inline code from `dist/polyfill.js` here
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
  </body>
</html>
```

Note that the code _must_ go in the `<head>` of your pages in order to work. See [how the polyfill works](#how-the-polyfill-works) for more details.

_**Tip:** while it's certainly possible to inline the code in `dist/polyfill.js` by copy and pasting it directly into your templates, it's better to automate this process in a build stepâ€”otherwise you risk the "base" and the "polyfill" scripts getting out of sync when new versions are released._

<a name="load-web-vitals-from-a-cdn"><a>

### From a CDN

The recommended way to use the `web-vitals` package is to install it from npm and integrate it into your build process. However, if you're not using npm, it's still possible to use `web-vitals` by requesting it from a CDN that serves npm package files.

The following examples show how to load `web-vitals` from [unpkg.com](https://unpkg.com), whether your targeting just Chromium-based browsers (using the "standard" version) or additional browsers (using the "base+polyfill" version):

**Load the "standard" version** (using a module script)

```html
<!-- Append the `?module` param to load the module version of `web-vitals` -->
<script type="module">
  import {getCLS, getFID, getLCP} from 'https://unpkg.com/web-vitals?module';

  getCLS(console.log);
  getFID(console.log);
  getLCP(console.log);
</script>
```

**Load the "standard" version** _(using a classic script)_

```html
<script>
(function() {
  var script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = 'https://unpkg.com/web-vitals';
  script.onload = function() {
    // When loading `web-vitals` using a classic script, all the public
    // methods can be found on the `webVitals` global namespace.
    webVitals.getCLS(console.log);
    webVitals.getFID(console.log);
    webVitals.getLCP(console.log);
  }
  document.head.appendChild(script);
}())
</script>
```

**Load the "base+polyfill" version** _(using a classic script)_

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script>
      // Inline code from `https://unpkg.com/web-vitals/dist/polyfill.js` here.
    </script>
  </head>
  <body>
    ...
    <!-- Load the UMD version of the "base" bundle. -->
    <script>
    (function() {
      var script = document.createElement('script');
      script.src = 'https://unpkg.com/web-vitals';
      script.onload = function() {
        // When loading `web-vitals` using a classic script, all the public
        // methods can be found on the `webVitals` global namespace.
        webVitals.getCLS(console.log);
        webVitals.getFID(console.log);
        webVitals.getLCP(console.log);
      }
      document.head.appendChild(script);
    }())
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Usage

### Basic usage

Each of the Web Vitals metrics is exposed as a single function that takes an `onReport` callback. This callback will be called any time the metric value is available and ready to be reported.

The following example measures each of the Core Web Vitals metrics and logs the result to the console once its value is ready to report.

_(The examples below import the "standard" version, but they will work with the polyfill version as well.)_

```js
import {getCLS, getFID, getLCP} from 'web-vitals';

getCLS(console.log);
getFID(console.log);
getLCP(console.log);
```

Note that some of these metrics will not report until the user has interacted with the page, switched tabs, or the page starts to unload. If you don't see the values logged to the console immediately, try reloading the page (with [preserve log](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/console/reference#persist) enabled) or switching tabs and then switching back.

Also, in some cases a metric callback may never be called:

- FID is not reported if the user never interacts with the page.
- FCP, FID, and LCP are not reported if the page was loaded in the background.

In other cases, a metric callback may be called more than once:

- CLS should be reported any time the [page's `visibilityState` changes to hidden](https://developers.google.com/web/updates/2018/07/page-lifecycle-api#advice-hidden).
- CLS, FCP, FID, and LCP are reported again after a page is restored from the [back/forward cache](https://web.dev/bfcache/).

_**Warning:** do not call any of the Web Vitals functions (e.g. `getCLS()`, `getFID()`, `getLCP()`) more than once per page load. Each of these functions creates a `PerformanceObserver` instance and registers event listeners for the lifetime of the page. While the overhead of calling these functions once is negligible, calling them repeatedly on the same page may eventually result in a memory leak._

### Report the value on every change

In most cases, you only want `onReport` to be called when the metric is ready to be reported. However, it is possible to report every change (e.g. each layout shift as it happens) by setting the optional, second argument (`reportAllChanges`) to `true`.

This can be useful when debugging, but in general using `reportAllChanges` is not needed (or recommended).

```js
import {getCLS} from 'web-vitals';

// Logs CLS as the value changes.
getCLS(console.log, true);
```

### Report only the delta of changes

Some analytics providers allow you to update the value of a metric, even after you've already sent it to their servers (overwriting the previously-sent value with the same `id`).

Other analytics providers, however, do not allow this, so instead of reporting the new value, you need to report only the delta (the difference between the current value and the last-reported value). You can then compute the total value by summing all metric deltas sent with the same ID.

The following example shows how to use the `id` and `delta` properties:

```js
import {getCLS, getFID, getLCP} from 'web-vitals';

function logDelta({name, id, delta}) {
  console.log(`${name} matching ID ${id} changed by ${delta}`);
}

getCLS(logDelta);
getFID(logDelta);
getLCP(logDelta);
```

_**Note:** the first time the `onReport` function is called, its `value` and `delta` properties will be the same._

In addition to using the `id` field to group multiple deltas for the same metric, it can also be used to differentiate different metrics reported on the same page. For example, after a back/forward cache restore, a new metric object is created with a new `id` (since back/forward cache restores are considered separate page visits).

### Send the results to an analytics endpoint

The following example measures each of the Core Web Vitals metrics and reports them to a hypothetical `/analytics` endpoint, as soon as each is ready to be sent.

The `sendToAnalytics()` function uses the [`navigator.sendBeacon()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Navigator/sendBeacon) method (if available), but falls back to the [`fetch()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API when not.

```js
import {getCLS, getFID, getLCP} from 'web-vitals';

function sendToAnalytics(metric) {
  const body = JSON.stringify({[metric.name]: metric.value});
  // Use `navigator.sendBeacon()` if available, falling back to `fetch()`.
  (navigator.sendBeacon && navigator.sendBeacon('/analytics', body)) ||
      fetch('/analytics', {body, method: 'POST', keepalive: true});
}

getCLS(sendToAnalytics);
getFID(sendToAnalytics);
getLCP(sendToAnalytics);
```

### Send the results to Google Analytics

Google Analytics does not support reporting metric distributions in any of its built-in reports; however, if you set a unique dimension value (in this case, the metric `id`, as shown in the examples below) on every metric instance that you send to Google Analytics, you can create a report yourself using the [Google Analytics Reporting API](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting) and any data visualization library you choose.

As an example of this, the [Web Vitals Report](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-vitals-report) is a free and open-source tool you can use to create visualizations of the Web Vitals data that you've sent to Google Analytics.

[![web-vitals-report](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/326742/101584324-3f9a0900-3992-11eb-8f2d-182f302fb67b.png)](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-vitals-report)

In order to use the [Web Vitals Report](https://github.com/GoogleChromeLabs/web-vitals-report) (or build your own custom reports using the API) you need to send your data to Google Analytics following one of the examples outlined below:

#### Using `analytics.js`

```js
import {getCLS, getFID, getLCP} from 'web-vitals';

function sendToGoogleAnalytics({name, delta, id}) {
  // Assumes the global `ga()` function exists, see:
  // https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/analyticsjs
  ga('send', 'event', {
    eventCategory: 'Web Vitals',
    eventAction: name,
    // The `id` value will be unique to the current page load. When sending
    // multiple values from the same page (e.g. for CLS), Google Analytics can
    // compute a total by grouping on this ID (note: requires `eventLabel` to
    // be a dimension in your report).
    eventLabel: id,
    // Google Analytics metrics must be integers, so the value is rounded.
    // For CLS the value is first multiplied by 1000 for greater precision
    // (note: increase the multiplier for greater precision if needed).
    eventValue: Math.round(name === 'CLS' ? delta * 1000 : delta),
    // Use a non-interaction event to avoid affecting bounce rate.
    nonInteraction: true,
    // Use `sendBeacon()` if the browser supports it.
    transport: 'beacon',

    // OPTIONAL: any additional params or debug info here.
    // See: https://web.dev/debug-web-vitals-in-the-field/
    // dimension1: '...',
    // dimension2: '...',
    // ...
  });
}

getCLS(sendToGoogleAnalytics);
getFID(sendToGoogleAnalytics);
getLCP(sendToGoogleAnalytics);
```

#### Using `gtag.js` (Universal Analytics)

```js
import {getCLS, getFID, getLCP} from 'web-vitals';

function sendToGoogleAnalytics({name, delta, id}) {
  // Assumes the global `gtag()` function exists, see:
  // https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/gtagjs
  gtag('event', name, {
    event_category: 'Web Vitals',
    // The `id` value will be unique to the current page load. When sending
    // multiple values from the same page (e.g. for CLS), Google Analytics can
    // compute a total by grouping on this ID (note: requires `eventLabel` to
    // be a dimension in your report).
    event_label: id,
    // Google Analytics metrics must be integers, so the value is rounded.
    // For CLS the value is first multiplied by 1000 for greater precision
    // (note: increase the multiplier for greater precision if needed).
    value: Math.round(name === 'CLS' ? delta * 1000 : delta),
    // Use a non-interaction event to avoid affecting bounce rate.
    non_interaction: true,

    // OPTIONAL: any additional params or debug info here.
    // See: https://web.dev/debug-web-vitals-in-the-field/
    // metric_rating: 'good' | 'ni' | 'poor',
    // debug_info: '...',
    // ...
  });
}

getCLS(sendToGoogleAnalytics);
getFID(sendToGoogleAnalytics);
getLCP(sendToGoogleAnalytics);
```

#### Using `gtag.js` (Google Analytics 4)

[Google Analytics 4](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/10089681) introduces a new Event model allowing custom parameters instead of a fixed category, action, and label. It also supports non-integer values, making it easier to measure Web Vitals metrics compared to previous versions.

```js
import {getCLS, getFID, getLCP} from 'web-vitals';

function sendToGoogleAnalytics({name, delta, value, id}) {
  // Assumes the global `gtag()` function exists, see:
  // https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/collection/ga4
  gtag('event', name, {
    // Built-in params:
    value: delta, // Use `delta` so the value can be summed.
    // Custom params:
    metric_id: id, // Needed to aggregate events.
    metric_value: value, // Optional.
    metric_delta: delta, // Optional.

    // OPTIONAL: any additional params or debug info here.
    // See: https://web.dev/debug-web-vitals-in-the-field/
    // metric_rating: 'good' | 'ni' | 'poor',
    // debug_info: '...',
    // ...
  });
}

getCLS(sendToGoogleAnalytics);
getFID(sendToGoogleAnalytics);
getLCP(sendToGoogleAnalytics);
```

### Send the results to Google Tag Manager

The recommended way to measure Web Vitals metrics with Google Tag Manager is using the [Core Web Vitals](https://www.simoahava.com/custom-templates/core-web-vitals/) custom template tag created and maintained by [Simo Ahava](https://www.simoahava.com/).

For full installation and usage instructions, see Simo's post: [Track Core Web Vitals in GA4 with Google Tag Manager](https://www.simoahava.com/analytics/track-core-web-vitals-in-ga4-with-google-tag-manager/).
